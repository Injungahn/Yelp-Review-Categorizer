I got the Florentine Benedict and my friend got the Corn Succotash &amp; White Cheddar Omelette (not pictured). Everything was great - savory, a little spice, comforting!<br><br> Friendly and quick service. I ended up going back to try the dinner menu a few nights later - the shrimp and grits was everything I wanted. The beignets are a must try - SO big and fluffy and filled to perfection.\n",

Portions are large and pricing is fair. I wish we could have managed a Beignet Flight!<br><br>Definitely a spot to seek out. It can be crowed at times so be patient. Well worth any wait.\n",

      "\n",
      "So good we went twice in one week! After a recommendation from the barista by our hotel we walked over to Brenda's for brunch on a Saturday. There was a wait but it moved quickly. I got the Florentine Benedict and my friend got the Corn Succotash & White Cheddar Omelette (not pictured). Everything was great - savory, a little spice, comforting! Friendly and quick service. I ended up going back to try the dinner menu a few nights later - the shrimp and grits was everything I wanted. The beignets are a must try - SO big and fluffy and filled to perfection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hadn't been here in years because the neighborhood has become increasingly rough and filthy and waiting for a table first thing in the morning under such circumstances isn't a good way to start the day.But snagged a reservation and finally returned today.Food. was good but service was decidedly uneven. Some servers were curt & incompetent (gave us wrong orders, had no patience and hurried us up), others were attentive.  Was very hesitant about leaving a tip.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love the other Brenda's in SF but this one did not live up to the hype. If i were to go back i'd only get the crawfish beignets and the gravy + biscuits.We got:- Beignet flight (5/5): highly recommend the apple + crawfish ones if you order singles!- pork belly grits (3/5): There's not enough acidity to cut down the fat of the pork belly so it's really hard to eat more than half- gravy + biscuits (5/5): gravy was incredible and the biscuits were super flaky- The coffee was so SO burnt :( There was a lot of grind sediment at the bottom of my cup which made it a really unpleasant morning experience.Service: great! the staff were all very nice :) Ambiance: during the brunch rush you definitely have to yell a bit to hear each other over the noise\n",
      "\n",
      "Another repeat visit and no disappointment from us. Great place for breakfast or brunch - and you won't need to eat again for awhile. The restaurant is close to the Tenderloin so be aware of your surroundings.We enjoyed the Succotash Omelet (at least my wife enjoyed it), the Pulled Pork Benedict and the Hangtown Fry. Portions are large and pricing is fair. I wish we could have managed a Beignet Flight!Definitely a spot to seek out. It can be crowed at times so be patient. Well worth any wait.\n",
